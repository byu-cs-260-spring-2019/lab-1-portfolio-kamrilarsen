    <h4 id="june27">Monday, June 27, 2016</h4>
    <p>So on Tuesday, we went to service, and they had like 15 extra hams that didn't fit in the freezer, so they had 
        everyone take one home. So I'm not quite sure what to do with a whole ham, but hey, whatcha gunna do? :) After 
        service, we grabbed my suitcase for exchanges and headed out to East Boston. We went to visit a less active 
        family who is nearly active again, and when we got there, their teenage boy grabbed my suitcase for me. I 
        didn't insist on taking it back from him. I'm progressing!! :) My family (and probably everyone else) knows 
        this is a huge step for me. Later that night we started exchanges with the Revere Spanish Sisters. I got to 
        go to their area with Hermana Gill!
        On Wednesday, we did some tracting and street contacting, before visiting a member who needed help with 
        FamilySearch. It took a little time, but we were able to get her 12 year old daughter an account (this 
        took many tries), and it was so awesome to see their excitement that the daughter could be baptized for 
        her great grandma.
        On Thursday, we visited Patricia, an investigator that the Cam 1 Elders are passing off to us because she 
        is more comfortable in Spanish. That was awesome, and she has a huge desire to raise her kids in the right 
        way, and it was so cool. Also, she saw us waiting at a bus stop and gave us a ride to the train station, 
        which was super nice of her.  Later in the day, we went to the grumpiest street in East Boston to tract. 
        It was kind of funny how many people were rudely not interested. Also, I've never met so many Hispanics 
        who didn't want to talk about God. But then we went to the happier part of East Boston and went contacting, 
        and we got some good potential investigators with return appointments :)
        On Friday, we had District Meeting, and afterwards we did Weekly Planning. We also finally got our mailbox 
        fixed, so that was super exciting! :) What was more exciting was that there was mail inside ;) Our 
        appointments all cancelled that night, and so we had some less actives we had been trying to find in 
        Somerville. No one was home, which was a little discouraging, but it's all good.
        On Saturday, we did chapel tours. We met this really cute Japanese student going to Harvard that came 
        inside, and we have an appointment set up to teach her on Wednesday. I don't get to be there because of 
        exchanges, but she is just awesome. We had a Book of Mormon display from the PVC, and there was one in 
        Japanese that she found, and she was really excited that we can help her know what happens when we die. 
        Later on we went and visited Juana, and taught the Restoration. It went really well, and her daughter 
        Aidsa was there too. We tried to stop by some other people, but they weren't home. Later that night we 
        had dinner with Hermana Palacios, and we had a lesson on Patriarchal Blessings, tithing, and a little 
        word of wisdom in there too. She is working on getting a temple recommend, so we are super excited for her!
        On Sunday, we got a call at 5:00 am from the non member friend of a less active we just found. That was 
        fun. Luckily my companion is awesome at being alert and sensitive to people in that kind of circumstance.  
        We then got a call from the Zone Leaders at 7:30, as we found out that Stake Reporting was supposed to be 
        with the Stake president 30 minutes previously... Somehow that slipped all of our minds... So we were out 
        the door and running across the street at 7:35. Church was really good, I love our members so much. Also, 
        I got to sight read 6 songs over the course of church. The Relief Society lesson was really good, I love 
        how Hispanics say anything they want to, and it ends up working out really well. After church, we grabbed 
        lunch and headed out to East Boston. None of the people we stopped by were home, until we went to a less 
        active we had found knocking doors that isn't on our records. He is absolutely awesome. Andy was baptized 
        in the Dominican Republic but went less active after 2 years, and then moved to the states. He has a 14 
        year old daughter named Angie, and she has this light in her eyes, and we talked a little bit about the 
        Book of Mormon with her, and she wants to take the lessons and come to mutual this week. Her dad is super 
        supportive of it, and I am so excited to get to teach her!! :) We got to translate a training meeting for 
        the Relief Society presidencies in the stake, and that was SO much fun. We also had a lesson with Alex and 
        Karen, and hopefully they will be coming to church this next Sunday. Alex is a less active, and doesn't 
        understand how to repent, but really wants to change, and he is so happy that we can help him. 
        Anyways, this week has been good. There were a couple rough patches, but all the people we work with are 
        absolutely amazing, and I love them so much. I love my mission! :)</p>

    <h4 id="july4">Monday, July 4th, 2016</h4>
    <p>Happy 4th of July! I hope you all have a ton of fun today, and I hope most of you have the day off!So this past 
        week was good, on Monday we had zone P-day, and we had a Camelot-themed capture the flag. I may have gotten 
        whacked in the eye and had a little bruise from it, but it was so much fun! Then at night we started exchanges 
        with the Lynnfield Sisters. I got to go with Sister Bullock, who just got to the mission. That was a lot of fun, 
        and she has some awesome greenie fire.On Tuesday we went out to East Boston and tried to do some stop bys, but 
        that didn't prove to be very successful, so we spent some time street contacting :) We got to visit with Angie 
        and with her dad's girlfriend, so it turned out to be a spanglish appointment, even though we were expecting 
        English... All these wonderful sisters we go on exchanges with are so patient with not knowing what is being 
        said/taught half of the time. We finished exchanges up, and then went to Harvard Station to start exchanges 
        with the Longfellow Park Sisters. I went to their area with Sister Harding, which was a ton of fun and a blast 
        from the past! :)On Wednesday we did a LOT of contacting. We went to Harvard campus first, but that didn't 
        really work, so we went to Boston Commons. We taught some lessons with random people on the benches, got quite 
        a few phone numbers, and found two new investigators! :) We also met some pretty crazy people, but that's to be 
        expected. We had dinner with a member, and then had a lesson with Mayu, the Japanese girl we met doing chapel 
        tours. We taught the Plan of Salvation, and she is just the cutest! It is super different to explain what a 
        prayer is, and have an entirely different way of teaching. But our member help was super awesome, and she speaks 
        Japanese, which was a huge tender mercy! On Thursday, I got to go to the temple! :) Jenny, a member, was going 
        through for the first time, and asked us to go with her, and we got permission to go! :) It was so cool. They a) 
        started the session late for her because we were a little late (30 minutes...) due to a problem with our ride 
        there, and no one else was there for the session yet and b) did the session in spanish for her. That was the 
        coolest! It was also really cool that I understood basically all of it, even though it was in the vosotros form, 
        which we don't use. Then after we went with her to pick a temple dress from the Distribution Center, which was 
        also lots of fun :) That evening we had a good lesson with Nelson, where we read from the Book of Mormon with 
        him. We read Jacob 4 because that is where he was! :) Then we spent the night doing monthly goals, supplies, 
        and miles, because our Google Docs wigged out and deleted all of the information the missionaries had submitted. 
        On Friday morning we visited Mario and ate half a pie and a tamale, and drank half a liter of orange juice. He is 
        so sweet! I can't wait for him to get Sundays off! Then in the afternoon we had a lesson with Yeisker and 
        Viyeurys and their cousin, and then with Ana, both on the word of wisdom. They accepted it super well! I'm going 
        to miss teaching those kids! They are leaving this Wednesday for the Dominican Republic for a month and a half. 
        Then we spent some time street contacting, and we taught two lessons on people's front steps, and we got a new 
        investigator! :)On Saturday, we visited Andy Diaz and his daughter Luz. We read 1 Nephi 1 with them and 
        challenged them to read one chapter a day. Then we had lunch and correlation with our new Relief Society 
        president, and that went well. We then did a stop by at one of our investigator's houses to try to help her 
        get to church, but she's kind of dragging her feet with that one because she doesn't know people. Church was 
        good on Sunday :) Afterwards we had a super good correlation with our Branch President, and he was so excited 
        to see that we had 20 investigators. I loved how he referred to them as future members of the church. Our ward 
        is super awesome and very missionary-minded, and I love how excited they are for the people we teach. They are 
        super good at fellowshipping! our night had a few things fall through, and then we walked home, because we 
        accidentally left one of the T passes at home, so we couldn't take the bus. But it was a super pretty night, 
        so it all works :)Then this morning we went to the beach and played some soccer with a bunch of missionaries, 
        and it was so much fun! It was a lot less crowded than we thought it would be, which was a plus. Well, I hope 
        you have an awesome day and enjoy the fireworks tonight! I love you all!  Love, Hermana Hafen</p>

    <h4 id="july11">Monday, July 11th, 2016</h4>
    <p>This week was awesome. I love Cambridge :)
        So last Monday we stayed out until 10:30, just until the fireworks started. Then we had to head back home, but 
        we heard them from our apartment, so that was lots of fun :) There were tons of cops out along the Charles 
        keeping an eye on things, and we ran into a lot of the Portuguese members, so that was fun :) 
        On Tuesday, we met up with Julie, a young woman, and went to a lesson with Patricia. She has a daughter who is 
        Two years older than Julie named Angela. Angela wouldn't come out for the lesson, but afterwards we were able 
        to have Julie introduce herself, and invite her to mutual. We had also talked to Patricia about Girls Camp, 
        and Patricia was more than happy to send her to it. We weren't sure if Angela would really want to, but we 
        invited her to it, and she got really excited and said she wanted to go. So that was super cool! In the 
        evening we went and said goodbye to Yeisker and Viyeurys, and took pictures with them. They will be in the 
        Dominican Republic until mid or late August, which makes us sad. But Viyeurys is turning 8 in the DR, so she 
        can be baptized with her family when she comes back! :)
        On Wednesday we had MLC, and that was an awesome meeting, as always :) Then we got a text from Patricia saying 
        that Angela wanted to go to mutual! That was so exciting. We caught a bus connection from the 80 to the 88 by 
        a matter of about 30 seconds at a random stop, which made it so we weren't late to mutual so we could show her 
        around and introduce her to the girls. It was so awesome. We helped make the food while they were learning how 
        to dance. All the girls did awesome at being her friend, it was so good. And she went up to one of the leaders 
        and asked to go to camp. They were ecstatic, and they have made arrangements so now she can go to camp! :)
        On Thursday we put up some flyers around Harvard square in the morning, planned for zone meeting, and had all 
        of our appointments and member helps cancel in the evening. So a slightly longer day, but we got done what we 
        needed to :)
        On Friday, we started interviews with President Miller at 9:00. Then we did DLC and Zone Meeting, which went 
        well. President stopped interviews during Zone Meeting, and then continued after during lunch. He wasn't able 
        to get through them all (#throwbacktoProvidence) and so we will finish them this coming week. I have such a 
        love for him, he is an absolutely amazing mission president. He does days of interviews, training, and 
        preparing in a row, and he just keeps going. I love my leaders.
        On Saturday, we had breakfast at a member's and my Spanish stomach failed me and I couldn't finish the food 
        for the life of me. Later on we did some Weekly Planning, and I went stir crazy. Later on there was a baby 
        shower for one of the members, and we stopped in for a few minutes. As we went to leave, we were directed back 
        in to get some food. We got a small plate, and got stopped again by one of the members saying "Que barbarided." 
        (how barbaric) Since we hadn't grabbed very much food. So they ushered us back in again, and loaded an 
        additional plate for us. I love them :). 
        On Sunday we saw so many miracles :) In Branch Council, our branch president spent the whole time having us 
        talk about our investigators, and then had each of the auxiliary leaders pick 2 or 3 to be in charge of 
        fellow-shipping. Everyone is super excited, and it was awesome. Then Patricia and Angela and Nelson all came 
        to church! The YW leaders offered to give Angela a ride home so she could stay for the last hour, because 
        Patricia had to leave after the first 2 blocks. I love our members :) Then Brother and Sister Alatriste came 
        out with us. They had originally said they could come out from 1-4, so we had 2 appointments planned. They 
        are just about the best member helps out there. We first went and visited Andy, Luz, and Diedry, and even 
        though the lesson went long, it was a really powerful lesson. We had had another lesson with Vanesa afterwards, 
        but by the time we got there it was 4, but the Alatristes offered to help us out with the lesson anyways. So she 
        was introduced to the Book of Mormon by Laura, another super awesome member, and she is about as prepared as 
        they come. She is a strong Catholic, but had an experience about a year ago in which she realized that her 
        relationship with God isn't as strong as she wants it to be, so now she is looking for more. She is searching, 
        and oh my goodness that lesson was awesome. Also a longer lesson, but it was just what she needed. I am so 
        excited to help her and teach her. Basically, yesterday was one of the best days thus far, and I love Cambridge 
        so much. God is so good, and is preparing so many people, as well as the members.
        Well, I hope you all have an amazing week! I love you all so much. The gospel is true and it blesses lives!
        Love,
        Hermana Hafen

    <h4 id="july18">Monday, July 18th, 2016</h4>
    <p>I love my mission :)
        On Tuesday, we went and visited Patricia and Angela. We officially picked Angela up as a new investigator :) 
        It was a really good lesson, especially to find out she hadn't taken the least bit of offense to something that 
        had happened in Sunday School. She is super prepared :) She was also super sweet, and gave Julie (a YW) and us 
        a ride to where we needed to go, even though it was super out of her way. All of our appointments and back ups 
        fell through throughout the rest of the day, but it was still a win with that lesson :)
        On Wednesday, NOTHING CANCELLED. We got all of our studies in, including language, did Weekly Planning, and 4 
        lessons! We had a lesson we weren't planning on with a less active named Juana and we talked about Paul's 
        conversion story for part of her Pathways homework. We had a lesson with Nelson and Hermano Paredes about the 
        Word of Wisdom, which Hermano Paredes had already basically taught it without knowing that would be our lesson. 
        We had a lesson with Juana, the less active's twin who is an investigator, and Aidsa about the Plan of 
        Salvation, and it went really well :) We are still trying to figure out how to get Aidsa to church though. 
        Then we visited Mario, one of the humblest people on the planet. He had read all of 1 Nephi, because he was a 
        little confused on the homework assignment. I just felt so much charity for him. Oh I can't wait for him to 
        get Sundays off! It was an absolutely blessed day, and I was on cloud 9 all day :)
        On Thursday we did chapel tours, and it was a pretty slow morning. We tried visiting a ton of people in East 
        Boston, but no one was home... so it was a longer day, but still good :) We did visit a member who is still 
        recovering from a stroke.
        On Friday we finished up interviews, and that was good. We got T-Texts in the afternoon! Well, I'll be staying 
        here in Cambridge another transfer, and Hermana Rubio will be joining me and Hermana Vaughan for the next 
        three weeks until Hermana Vaughan goes home. Trio status! :) Also, the Zone Leaders are a trio, so there will 
        be six leaders in the zone the next three weeks, so that will be fun :) There were a ton of changes this 
        transfer, so it will be interesting. Every companionship had a change in the zone. That evening we visited 
        two less actives with the elders quorum's president, so that was good. There was a cute little girl who kept 
        putting a stuffed lion on my head, so that was also really fun :)
        On Saturday, we spent a lot of time trying to find less actives, and no one was home. Also, it was super hot, 
        and I may have gone slightly crazy at some points, giggling uncontrollably. That evening we had a good lesson 
        with Nelson on tithing :)
        On Sunday, we had an amazing day. We had Nelson and Vanesa at church. Vanesa learned about the Word of Wisdom 
        in Sunday School, and she accepted it super well. After church a youth got baptized, and both of them came to 
        the baptism to see it :) Then, Vanesa wanted to visit her member friend, who had an emergency surgery this 
        past week. It went so well, and we had an impromptu lesson, and she got a priesthood blessing :) She is so 
        sweet, and she is so hungry for what the Gospel brings. And she is living what she is learning, because she 
        wants it so bad.
        So this week has been amazing, and God is blessing Cambridge. I absolutely love being here, and I have such a 
        love for these people. I am so happy. This is such an amazing place. Our members are so kind to us to always 
        give us food too :) 
        I hope you all have a wonderful week, I love you so much!
        Love,
        Hermana Hafen
    </p>

    <h4 id="july25">Monday, July 25, 2016</h4>
    <p>This week has been awesome, and I love being in a trio! :) And yes, members ask all the time why we have 3 
        missionaries together because they know 2 is the standard. :) On Monday, the rest of P-Day was a lot of fun 
        playing a soccer game in some blow up bubbles and spending time in Boston. We played Red Light, Green Light for 
        FHE and talked about the importance of obedience, and that was fun :)On Tuesday, we got to visit Yajaira! :) She 
        came back from New York, and it was so good to visit her again. Sometimes it is worrisome when an investigator 
        leaves for an extended period of time, but she is just as committed to learning and progressing as before :) That 
        was such a relief. Our member help randomly brought up the Word of Wisdom, and she took it like a champ, she is 
        awesome :) In the evening we went with a member to try to visit less active young women. We knocked on one door, 
        and after a minute we rang the doorbell. And it didn't stop ringing. For the next 3-5 minutes. (Probably longer, 
        we left, and it was still ringing as we left...) It was so funny, and I was laughing so hard!On Wednesday, we had 
        exchanges. That was crazy and fun :) 9 Spanish sisters and 1 Portuguese sister all in one spot, with lots of 
        luggage, and Elders along to help out with luggage or get a ride somewhere. So to help everyone always have a 
        companion, someone needed to go with Sister Capece, the Portuguese sister. So I got to drive her from Revere out 
        to the Weston chapel to get TiWi installed, and then drive her to the mission home a few hours later to get the 
        new missionary she is training. I love Sister Capece. Also, there were a ton of missionaries at the chapel, 
        so that was fun too. At about 4:30 Hermana Vaughan and Hermana Rubio came and picked me up, and that was good :) 
        We had a super good lesson with Mario, and President Rivera (branch president) got to come :)On Thursday we got to 
        visit Ana :). She is still trying to get situated in her new house, but it was so good to visit her :) Later on we 
        had an amazing lesson with Vanessa. We talked about the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and she said she would fast with us 
        for confirmation about August 13th as her baptismal date! She is amazing.On Friday, it was really funny, because 
        one of the missionaries from our zone that had finished his mission on Wednesday was at the church. We all did a 
        double take. His parents had come to pick him up, and he was getting the elders that were shotgunning the area 
        some of the basic information and details about the area. We had a lesson with an investigator later on in the 
        day, and at first there was a little boy running around with nothing on his bottom half, and then he had an 
        accident on the floor, and it was just an interesting lesson, but they weren't phased by it, so neither were we, 
        and it all ended up going just fine. :) We had dinner at a member's house, and Vanessa came over. And she called 
        her mom in Mexico to tell her about her wanting to get baptized, and her mom got really mad. So everything is on 
        a stand-still for now, hopefully everything works out. Luckily she has REALLY good member support from multiple 
        members. On Saturday, we got to see Andy and Diedry, so that was really good :) We talked about eternal marriage, 
        and they said they will come to church this next Sunday! :) There was this random guy on the road back from there 
        in East Boston that gave us water bottles, so that was really nice of him :) The conversation turned political 
        really fast, but he was a good guy, and he was very respectful. We also got to visit with Nelson and Karen and 
        Alex, which was awesome :) Yesterday was also a good day at church :) We had 4 investigators come! :) Then after 
        church Jade, a YW, came with us out to East Boston, but we ran into the person we were going to go visit on the 
        street, and she was going with her kids to the beach... so that didn't really work out. We had really good lunch 
        with a member, and then ended up spending a lot of the night doing numbers. But this week was absolutely amazing. 
        I love Cambridge so much, and there are so many miracles! I love being a missionary!I hope you all have a wonderful 
        week, and thank you again for all your support! Love, Hermana Hafen
